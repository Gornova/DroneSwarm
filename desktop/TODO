Sprint 1
	+ base station with radius
	+ base stations create drones
	+ drones moves after creation in a random point in base station radius
	+ two different teams: red and blue
	+ drones fighting
	+ dones can destroy base station
	
Sprin 2
	+ neutral spots to control
	+ neutral zones generate drones
	+ add action command pattern
	+ select a station command 
	+ draw rectangle and select drones and move them using right click
	- command for drones
	- dragging for creating selection
	- proper AI

	
	
NICE TO HAVE:
	for drones and bases use geometry instead of images
