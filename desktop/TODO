Sprint 1
	+ base station with radius
	+ base stations create drones
	+ drones moves after creation in a random point in base station radius
	+ two different teams: red and blue
	+ drones fighting
	+ dones can destroy base station
	
Sprint 2
	+ neutral spots to control
	+ neutral zones generate drones
	+ add action command pattern
	+ draw rectangle and select drones and move them using right click
	+ highlight selected drones
	+ center player one wins correctly
	+ first AI
	
Sprint 3
	+ code refactor
	+ new selection mode (thanks to VaTTeRGeR)
	+ fix drone selection color after a new selection (thanks to VaTTeRGeR)
	- command for drones
	- proper AI

	
	
NICE TO HAVE:
	for drones and bases use geometry instead of images
