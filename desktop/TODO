Sprint 1
	+ base station with radius
	+ base stations create drones
	+ drones moves after creation in a random point in base station radius
	+ two different teams: red and blue
	+ drones fighting
	+ dones can destroy base station
	
Sprin 2
	+ neutral spots to control
	- proper AI
	- levels

	
	
NICE TO HAVE:
	for drones and bases use geometry instead of images
	remove instanceof and use entity type
